**Data Structure**, a class of POSTECH, is an essential area of study for computer scientists and for anyone who will ever undertake any serious programming task. This course deals with the fundamentals of organizing and manipulating data efficiently using clean conceptual models. Students study many of the important conceptual data types, their implementation, and analysis of their efficiency. Topics will cover algorithm analysis, lists, trees, priority queues, dictionaries (hash tables, balanced search trees), graphs, strings (tries, pattern matching), and sorting.
